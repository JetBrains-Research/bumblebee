# AST-transformations

An IntelliJ-based IDE plugin for performing Python AST transformations using PSI elements. 
You can use this plugin as a library or as a tool to work with Python PSI. 
The differences between these options can be found below.

## Available transformations

- [x] [Anonymization](./docs/transformations/Anonymization.md)
- [x] [Augmented Assignment](./docs/transformations/AugmentedAssignment.md)
- [x] [Comments Removal](./docs/transformations/CommentsRemoval.md)
- [x] [Comparison Unification](./docs/transformations/ComparisonUnification.md)
- [x] [Constant folding](./docs/transformations/ConstantFolding.md)
- [x] [Dead Code Removal](./docs/transformations/DeadCodeRemoval.md)
- [x] [Expression Unification](./docs/transformations/ExpressionUnification.md)
- [x] [If Statement Redundant Lines Removal](./docs/transformations/IfRedundantLinesRemovalTransformation.md)
- [x] [Multiple Operator Comparison](./docs/transformations/MultipleOperatorComparison.md)
- [x] [Multiple Target Assignment](./docs/transformations/MultipleTargetAssignmentTransformation.md)
- [x] [Outer Not Elimination](./docs/transformations/OuterNotElimination.md)

## Installation

Just clone the repo by `git clone https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/ast-transformations`.


## Getting started as a tool

Run the command `./gradlew :ast-transformations-plugin:cli -Pinput=<Input directory with python files> -Poutput=<Output directory> -Pyaml=<YAML config path>`.
The YAML configuration file example can be found [here](./config.yaml).
Set of the transformations is applied `n apply` times. Each round for each transformation the random  
number between `0.0` and `1.0` is generated. If this value is less than `p` for the current transformation,
the transformation will be applied to the source files. The result for each round is stored in the separated folder.

For example, the source files are stored in the `source` folder, `n apply` is `5`, and
we have a list of `3` transformations. The following steps will be executed `5` times:
1. Get list of the transformations for the current round according to generated probability. 
   The size of the list is no more than `3`;
2. Apply the list of the transformations to the files from the `source` folder. 
   **Note**, we create new files to store the result and the files in the `source` folder do not change.
3. Save the result


## Getting started as a library

You can use this plugin as a library in your plugin by importing it in `settings.gradle.kts` and `build.gradle.kts files`:

1. File `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
sourceControl {
    gitRepository(URI.create("https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/ast-transformations.git")) {
        producesModule("org.jetbrains.research.ml.ast.transformations:ast-transformations")
    }
}
```

2. File `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("org.jetbrains.research.ml.ast.transformations:ast-transformations") {
    version {
        branch = "master"
    }
}
```

The available features:

1. Forward transformations
2. Backward transformations
3. Find edits between two PSIs and apply them to get second PSI from the first PSI. 
   To find edits we use [GumTree](https://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree) library.
   
All usage examples can be found in the [test](./src/test/kotlin/org/jetbrains/research/ml/ast) folder.
